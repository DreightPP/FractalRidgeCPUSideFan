# CPU side fans mount for Fractal Design Ridge case

I bought a Fractal Design Ridge. Amazing case, awesome design but holy cow the cpu is toasty. Then i saw some unused space right by the CPU and it struck to me: "what if i can fit a couple of 40mm fans here?". So i designed this!

- Easy and non-destructive mod.
It uses the existing holes that are meant for the feet with the case in vertical position, which wasn't my case. Also wide enough for standard M5 fan screws. So no drill needed, yay!

- Clearance. 
With a total thickness of ~13mm (10mm fans and 3mm print) I didn't encounter any problem with the cables and connectors in the area. This should be true even with different motherboards, but i guess you have to try with your build.
Side note: theoretically you could also fit two 60mm fans, there is just enough space between the frame pieces, but in my build it pushed the power extension cable against the cpu cooler a bit too much for my peace of mind, so I discarded the idea

- Temperature gains. 
Definitely without any empirical system i can say the CPU temperature dropped around anywhere from 3 to 5 degree celsius. The other gain is the improved airflow to the RAM and VRMs.

PC Specs:
.CPU: Intel i7-13700K
.MOBO: ROG STRIX Z790-I GAMING WIFI
.COOLER: NOCTUA NH-L12S
.RAM: CORSAIR VENGEANCE DDR5 2x16GB

Print it, try it, if it helps i'm happy
